# Data Structure Implementations
The LinkedList, BST (Binary Search Tree), and AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis Tree) are in Java (JDK 12 was the current version at the time of writing this code). 

They are generic type implementations and so in order to use them, you will need to declare and create an instance of them inside a main method.
